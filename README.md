# wayside
Find it awkward to network at conferences or hackathons? Wish there was some way to find people with common interests at these events without being obnoxious? Yearn for the nostalgia of the Nintendo 3DS' Streetpass? Unsure what to do with your overpowered hardware badge that you spent 15 SGD per unit on? Recruiter? Friends ditched you for the day? Looking for someone to hang out with?

Wayside lets you find Hot Programmers with Sick Skillz in your area (no clickbait)! Using ESP-NOW for broadcasting and proximity estimation and BLE for communication with your personal device, Wayside will passively announce your interests and skills to other participants. When you're in proximity of someone with high compatibility, you both will get notified and yall can #LinkUp and get #LinkedIn.

Features:
- Cryptographically Secure (can confirm)
- Lightweight and Intuitive
- Deployed on all those cheapo platforms you see people use at hackathons for free deployments
- The network stack was built from scratch so that's how you know it's good
